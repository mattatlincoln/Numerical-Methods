## Learning Objectives

- LO1: Apply numerical methods for curve fitting and solving various equations.

- LO2:Critically analyse applied mathematical problems, choose and apply appropriate numerical methods for their solution.

- LO3: Implement numerical solutions in efficient computer codes using a high level computer language.

## Assessments

This module will have two assignments at the end of each semester

### Assignments
assignments will consist of mini projects to be tackled over a period of a few days e.g. construct a predictive model from this data using methods you have seen in the module. They will be marked on an extended rubric detailing requirements for each degree classification:

- Clear explanation of the problem addressed in mathematical terms
- Explanation of the choice of method applied
- Details of the numerical method implementation in your chosen language
- Quality of the code - including comments, and testing.
- Presentation of results and analysis

A full rubric will be provided and examples given leading up to the assignments.

## Deadlines

There will be two assignments. They will be towards the end semester 1 and 2 you can see the times on the assessment timetable on Bb for all your modules.

## Logbooks

Logbooks will not be directly assessed in this module.

!!! note
we really do recommend that you keep a logbook for your own benefit. It is good professional practice and ... they will help you a lot in completing the assignments in a reasonable amount of time.

Also, when submitting work you should attach evidence of your working, which would be very similar to relevant pages from your logbook.

## Module Contents

- Curve fitting.
- Numerical solution of non-linear equations.
- Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations.
- Solving systems of equations.
- Numerical solution of partial differential equations.
- Elements of stochastic methods.

## Tools

in principle you can use any high level programming language as the focus is on understanding the numerical methods not the computing.

- we recommend and support the use of Python
- you can use C++ but this will be rather more difficult (in my opinion)
- To work with C++ you can use MS Visual Studio which is installed in the computer labs and also is freely downloadable from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). There are many other options and depending on the power of your computer and operating system there may be better options - ask us.
- to work with Python I recommend Anaconda python which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - click on the download button then pick the correct installer. I like using Jupyter notebooks – see the notebooks on Blackboard for reminder on how to use them - but there are many other nice working environments.

You can use either of these languages – it would be very beneficial for you to see what parts are essential and what are trivial details of a particular language to try and use both. Would be good for your CV too.
